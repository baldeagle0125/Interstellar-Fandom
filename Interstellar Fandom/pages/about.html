            Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written,
            directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway,
            Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine.
            Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group
            of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search 
            of a new home for mankind.<br><br>

            Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in
            a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife,
            Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through
            Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics
            Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book,
            The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures,
            and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it
            on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began
            in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses
            extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created
            additional digital effects.<br><br>

            Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. 
            In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using 
            digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million 
            with subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It received 
            positive reviews for its acting, direction, screenplay, musical score, visual effects, 
            ambition and themes. It has also received praise from many astronomers for its scientific 
            accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics. Since its premiere "Interstellar" gained 
            a cult following, and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one of the best science fiction 
            movies. Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning 
            Best Visual Effects, and received numerous accolades.
