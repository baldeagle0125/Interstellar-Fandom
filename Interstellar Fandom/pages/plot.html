        <p class="plotParagraph">
            In 2067, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, teen son, Tom, and 10-year-old daughter, Murph. After a dust storm, patterns inexplicably appear on Murph's dust-covered bedroom floor. Murph believes a ghost created them, but Cooper deduces the patterns were made by gravity variations and represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, whom Cooper knows.<br><br>

            Professor Brand reveals that a group of unknown, presumingly extra-terrestrial beings placed a wormhole near Saturn in 2019, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a supermassive black hole named Gargantua. Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to survey the planets, and three — Dr. Mann, Laura Miller, and Wolf Edmunds — reported positive results. Professor Brand reveals two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing an antigravitational propulsion theory to propel settlements into space. In contrast, Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to settle a habitable planet.<br><br>

            Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. Also going are Dr. Amelia Brand (Prof. Brand's daughter), Dr. Doyle, and Romilly. Before leaving, Cooper gives a distraught Murph his wristwatch to compare their relative time for when he returns. After traversing the wormhole, the crew reaches Miller's planet. Due to Gargantua's proximity, time is severely dilated, meaning every hour on the planet equals seven Earth years. Romilly remains aboard Endurance to research Gargantua while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a landing craft to investigate the water planet for one hour. The group finds Miller's ship wreckage just before a giant wave kills Doyle. Cooper and Brand barely survive, and their delayed departure results in them reaching Endurance 23 years later in Earth time, though only a few hours for them. Once arriving back aboard the ship, the group deduces that Gargantua's gravitational pull and tidal effects are too strong for Miller's planet to be suitable for human habitation.<br><br>
            
            The crew then travels on to Mann's planet, where they revive him from cryostasis. Meanwhile, now a NASA scientist herself, Murph has transmitted a message announcing John Brand's death. She also angrily claims Cooper and Brand knew that Plan A, which required unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable, dooming those left on Earth. Cooper then intends to return to Earth, while Brand and Romilly will remain on Mann's planet to initiate Plan B and set up permanent habitation. However, Mann then reveals that the planet is actually uninhabitable, and that he sent falsified data in order to be rescued and sent home. Out of desperation, Mann then attempts to kill Cooper and hijack the Endurance. Romilly is then killed by a booby trap, while Brand and Cooper try to regain control of the ship. A deranged Dr. Mann is then killed during a failed docking operation, severely damaging Endurance. After another problematic docking maneuver, Cooper eventually regains control of the mission.<br><br>
            
            With insufficient fuel to reach the final potential world dubbed "Edmunds' planet", Cooper and Brand use a slingshot maneuver so close to Gargantua that time dilation ages everyone on Earth another 51 years relative to those aboard Cooper's ship. Cooper and robot TARS jettison themselves to shed weight and propel Endurance to ensure it and Brand have enough momentum to reach Edmunds' planet. Slipping through Gargantua's event horizon, they eject from their respective craft and land inside a massive, four-dimensional structure dubbed the tesseract, likely powered by Gargantua's singularity. Across different time periods, Cooper can then see through the bookcases of Murph's old bedroom and weakly interacts with its gravity, realizing that he was Murph's "ghost" all along.<br><br>
            
            Speculating that the tesseract was not constructed by aliens but rather by future humans who have access to time travel technology yet cannot interact with the past themselves, Cooper realizes he and TARS may have been brought there to relay information to Murph that is critical to humanity's survival and the preservation of the timeline. Cooper uses gravitational waves to encode NASA's coordinates in the dust patterns in Murph's room before manipulating the second hand of Murph's wristwatch using Morse code to transmit data that TARS collected from within Gargantua. On Earth, the adult Murph realizes the "ghost" is her father and deciphers the message.<br><br>
            
            Ejected from the tesseract, Cooper is then presumably rescued by the crew of another ship, and awakens on a space habitat orbiting Saturn, where he reunites with an elderly Murph. Having used the quantum data Cooper sent through the warped timeline, it is revealed that the younger Murph solved the gravitational theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's mass exodus and transformation into a spacefaring civilization. Nearing death and with her own family, Murph urges Cooper to return to Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to fly back through the wormhole to Edmunds' planet, where Brand, after burying the deceased Edmunds, prepares a base for future human colonization on the breathable and life-supporting planet.
